gallery-viewer
==============

Small PHP and JavaScript gallery script. Very automated. Bases on jQuery-stuff.

To use, just clone. With the upload.htm you can just add pictures to your gallery.
Just try it out. Sourcecode is free to use and change.

Planned feature:
-Turn on/off categories
-Give category colors / palettes for default colors
