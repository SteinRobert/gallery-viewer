gallery-viewer
==============

Small PHP and JavaScript gallery script. Very automated. Bases on jQuery-stuff.

To use, just clone. With the upload.htm you can just add pictures to your gallery.
Just try it out. Sourcecode is free to use and change.

<b>Planned features:<br></b>
-Turn on/off categories<br>
-Give category colors / palettes for default colors<br>
-make backend more fancy<br>
-more backend functionality like category order, color theme picker...
<br><br>
All in all the use should be self explaining.
